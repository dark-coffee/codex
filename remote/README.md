# Remote Work

I'm fortunate enough to be a remote worker. A global pandemic helped to push me in that direction, sprinkle in a couple of career decisions, and here we are. Outside of a couple of meetings scattered across the country, I'm 100% remote.

## Environment

### Setup

- [Samsung 49 inch Ultrawide Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-LC49RG90SSRXXU-Curved-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B08WWL7CC9) - so shiny and good and will burn out your retinas at full brightness

### Utilities

- [miro](https://miro.com) - interactive collaborative whiteboard software
- [Goodnotes 5](https://goodnotes.com) - a great notetaking app for Apple devices. I find it incredibly useful, and use it for my daily to-do, and any notes I'm taking as I'm working.

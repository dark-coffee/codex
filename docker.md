# Docker

Docker is actually really easy to use. I would highly recommend the use of Docker-Compose over Docker Desktop.

## Docker Desktop

For Windows this requires the installation of WSL2.

## Docker-Compose

* yaml files

### SQL Server

#### Volumes & Persisting Data

In theory, you're using this to run a SQL Server instance, so naturally you'll want to persist your data. Doing so is actually pretty easy.  
You just need to utilize volumes.

#### Sample SQL Server Compose File

```yml

```

#### Restoring Databases using T-SQL

```sql

```

## Docker Hub

Has a pull limit of 100 per hour unless you have an account!

# Docker

Docker is actually really easy to use. I would highly recommend the use of Docker-Compose over Docker Desktop.

## Docker Desktop

## Docker-Compose

### SQL Server

* Volumes
* Persisting data
* Retoring databases

## Docker Hub

Has a pull limit of 100 per hour unless you have an account!

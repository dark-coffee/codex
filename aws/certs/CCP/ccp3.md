## Security and Architecture Overview

In this module, we'll be:

- Reviewing core concepts around security and architecture
- Exploring the AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- Introducing the AWS Well Architected Framework
- Examining fault tolerance and high availability on AWS
- Understanding provided tools for compliance

### Acceptable Use Policy

> ***Acceptable Use Policy** is AWS's policy for acceptable and unacceptable uses of their cloud platform. All users must agree with this policy to have an account on the platform.*
> 
- Sending unsolicited mass emails is prohibited
- Hosting or distributing harmful content is prohibited
- Penetration tests are allowed for a list of specific services

### Least Privilege Access

> ***Least Privilege Access**: When granting permission for a user to access AWS resources, you should grant them the minimum permissions needed to complete their tasks and no more.*
> 

## Shared Responsibility Model

> *Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. 
- Amazon Web Services, Shared Responsibility model*
> 

### Shared Responsibility Summary

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%201.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%201.png)

### Shared Responsibility Model

**AWS Responsibility**

- Access control & training for Amazon employees
- Global data centers and underlying network
- Hardware for global infrastructure
- Configuration management for infrastructure
- Patching cloud infrastructure and services

**Customer Responsibility**

- Individual access to cloud resources and training
- Data security and encryption (both in transit and at rest)
- Operating system, network, and firewall configuration
- All code deployed onto cloud infrastructure
- Patching guest operating system and custom applications

## AWS Well-architected Framework

> *The **AWS Well-architected Framework** is a collection of best practices across five key pillars for how to best create systems that create business value on AWS.*
> 

### Pillars of the Well-architected Framework

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%202.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%202.png)

### Well-architected Framework Documentation

The documentation for the AWS Well-architected Framework can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)

## High-availability and Fault-Tolerance

> *Everything fails all the time. 
- Werner Vogels - CTO, Amazon*
> 

High-availability and Fault-Tolerance fall under the Reliability pillar of the Well-architected Framework. 

### Reliability on AWS

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%203.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%203.png)

### Building Solutions on AWS

- Most managed AWS services provide high-availability out of the box
- When building solutions directly on EC2, fault tolerance must be architected
- Multiple availability zones should be leveraged
- Some services can enable fault tolerance in your custom applications
    - Simple Queue Service (SQS)
    - Route 53
    

## Compliance

### Common Compliance Standards

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%204.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%204.png)

### Compliance Services

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%205.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%205.png)

### Demo

In this demo, we'll be:

- Examining compliance reports in AWS Artifact
- Exploring conformance packs in AWS Config

**Conformance Packs in AWS Config**

![AWS Config Dashboard](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%206.png)

AWS Config Dashboard

To deploy a conformance pack, we can enter the conformance pack dashboard from the menu, and select '**Deploy conformance pack**'

![Conformance packs dashboard](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%207.png)

Conformance packs dashboard

Here we can choose a sample or personal template - in this example we're using PCI DSS as we'll be processing credit card information

![Conformance pack template selector](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%208.png)

**Compliance Reports in AWS Artifact**

![AWS Artifact Dashboard](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%209.png)

AWS Artifact Dashboard

Here we can view all of our compliance reports, and any agreements that we have in place with AWS - for example if we were storing HIPAA-compliant data, we would need to have a BAA agreement in place with AWS, and we would find that here.

For some of these reports, we will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement with AWS to obtain access to them. 

## Scenario Based Review

### Scenario 1

- Jane's company is building an application to process credit cards
- They will be processing cards directly and not through a service
- Their bank needs a PCI DSS compliance report for AWS

***Where would Jane go to get this information?***

<aside>
‚úÖ AWS Artifact

## Overview

> ***Least Privilege Access**: When granting permission for a user to access AWS resources, you should grant them the minimum permissions needed to complete their tasks and no more.*
> 

In this module, we'll be:

- Introducing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Reviewing the IAM identity types
- Enabling Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
- Introducing Amazon Cognito

## Introduction to AWS IAM

- Service that controls access to AWS resources
- Using the service is free
- Manages both authentication and authorization
- Supports identity federation through SAML providers including Active Directory

### AWS IAM Identities

![AWS IAM identity types](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2010.png)

AWS IAM identity types

### Policies in AWS IAM

A AWS IAM Policy:

- A JSON document that defines permissions for an AWS IAM identity (prinicpal)
- Defines both the AWS services that the identity can access and what actions can be taken on that service
- Can be either customer managed or managed by AWS

### Example IAM Policy

![Example AWS IAM JSON Policy](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2011.png)

# Disaster Recovery on AWS

<aside>
üóìÔ∏è Wednesday 4th August 2021

</aside>

## Overview

> ***Disaster recovery** (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster. Any event that has a negative impact on a company's business continuity or finances could be termed a disaster. This includes hardware or software failure, a network outage, a power outage, physical damage to a building like fire or flooding, human error or some other significant event.
- Amazon Web Services*
> 

### Needs for Disaster Recovery

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2040.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2040.png)

Loss of data center / failure of cloud services

### Module Overview

We'll be:

- Understanding the need for a disaster recovery strategy
- Reviewing the four different disaster recovery approaches on AWS
- Exploring the factors to know when selecting an approach
- Examining specific scenarios and disaster recovery needs

## Disaster Recovery Architectures

![Disaster Recovery Scenarios](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2041.png)

Disaster Recovery Scenarios

### Backup and Restore

- Production data is backed up into Amazon S3
- Data can be stored in either standard or archival storage classes
- EBS data can be stored as snapshots in Amazon S3 also
- In a Disaster Recovery event, a process is started to launch a new environment
- This approach has the longest recovery time, but the least cost

### Pilot Light

> *The **Pilot Light** method gives you a quicker recovery time than the backup-and-restore method because the core pieces of the system are already running and are continually kept up to date.
- Amazon Web Services*
> 
- Key infrastructure components are kept running in the cloud
- Designed to reduced recovery time over the Backup and Restore approach
- Does incur cost of this infrastructure continually running in the cloud
- AMI's are prepared for additional systems and can be launched quickly

### Warm Standby

- A scaled-down version of the full environment is running in the cloud
- Critical systems can be running on less capable instance types
- Instance types and other systems can be ramped up for Disaster Recovery events
- Does incur cost of this infrastructure continually running in the cloud

### Multi Site

- Full environment is running in the cloud at all times
- Utilizes instance types needed for production not just recovery
- Provides a near seamless recovery process
- Incurs the most cost over the other approaches

## Selecting a Disaster Recovery Architecture

![DR Approach Considerations](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2042.png)

DR Approach Considerations

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

> ***Recovery Time Objective** is the time it takes to get your systems back up and running to the ideal business state after a disaster recovery event.*
> 

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

> *Recovery Point Objective is the amount of data loss (in terms of time) for a production system during a disaster recovery event.*
> 

### Disaster Recovery Scenarios

![Disaster Recovery Scenarios Diagram](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2041.png)

Disaster Recovery Scenarios Diagram

- Multi Site has the lowest RTO & RPO, but the most cost
- Backup and Restore has the highest RTO & RPO, but the least cost
- Pilot Light & Warm standby can be customized based on your RTO & RPO needs (i.e. production databases but scaled down)

## Scenario Based Review

### Scenario 1

- Roger‚Äôs company runs several production workloads in AWS
- Roger is tasked with architecting the disaster recovering approach
- His organization wants there to be a seamless transition during an event

***Which disaster recovery approach would Roger‚Äôs company use for this?***

<aside>
‚úÖ Multi Site

</aside>

### Scenario 2

- Jennifer‚Äôs company is a startup
- They do not currently have a disaster recovery approach

# Architecting Applications on Amazon EC2

<aside>
üóìÔ∏è Thursday 5th August 2021

</aside>

## Overview

In this module, we'll be:

- Reviewing scaling approaches and services for Amazon EC2
- Examining approaches for controlling access to Amazon EC2 instances
- Exploring services to protect infrastructure from hacking and attacks
- Introducing developer tools on AWS
- Reviewing approaches for launching pre-defined solutions on amazon EC2

## Scaling EC2 Infrastructure

![Infrastructure scaling types](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2043.png)

Infrastructure scaling types

![Amazon EC2 Horizontal Scaling Services](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2044.png)

Amazon EC2 Horizontal Scaling Services

### Amazon EC2 Auto-Scaling Group

- Launch template defines the instance configuration for the group
- Define the minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances
- Performs health checks on each instance (can check URLs to retrieve a status code and take action based on returned codes)
- Exists within 1 or more availability zones in a single region
- Works with on-demand and spot instances.

**Amazon EC2 Horizontal Scaling Example**

![**Amazon EC2 Horizontal Scaling Example**](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2045.png)

**Amazon EC2 Horizontal Scaling Example**

In this example, we have an Auto-Scaling Group running across 2 availability zones. Our desired number of instances is 2, so the group has scaled appropriately across the zones. In-between the users and our instances is an Application Load Balancer, which routes users to an available server. 

In this example, we lose the instance in availability zone a, and the load balancer will stop sending traffic to the server, until the Auto-Scaling Group can terminate the server, and spin up a new server in its place.

### AWS Secrets Manager

- Secure way to integrate credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secret content (prevents us storing them on the servers)
- Integrates natively with RDS, DocumentDB, and Redshift
- Can auto-rotate credentials with integrated services
- Enables fine-grained access control to secrets

## Controlling Access to EC2 Instances

![Security in Amazon VPC](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2046.png)

Security in Amazon VPC

### Security Groups

- Serve as a firewall for your EC2 instances
- Control inbound and outbound traffic
- Works at the instance level
- EC2 instances can belong to multiple security groups
- VPC's have default security groups
- Must be explicitly associated with an EC2 instance
- By default all outbound traffic is allowed

### Network ACL's

- Works at the subnet level with a VPC (every instance in the subnet gets the ACL)
- Enables you to allow and deny traffic
- Each VPC has a default ACL that allows all inbound and outbound traffic
- Custom ACL's deny all traffic until rules are added

### AWS VPN

- Creates an encrypted tunnel into your VPC
- Can be used to connect your data center or even individual client machines
- Supported in two services:
    - Site-to-site VPN (connecting a data center)
    - Client VPN

**AWS Site-to-Site VPN Example**

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2047.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2047.png)

In this example of a Site-to-Site VPN, the corporate data center has a customer gateway, to direct traffic, and the VPC has a VPN gateway to receive traffic.

This is different to AWS Direct Connect, as you do not have a direct connection to the AWS Global Infrastructure, traffic travels over the public internet, and is encrypted the entire way. 

## Protecting Infrastructure from Attacks

### AWS Security Services

![Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2048.png](Introduction%20to%20Security%20and%20Architecture%20on%20AWS%202eb1275312a74ea1ae4b90fd7e7867fa/Untitled%2048.png)

> ***Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** is a type of attach where a server or group of servers are flooded with more traffic than they can handle in a coordinated effort to bring the system down.*
> 

### AWS Shield

- Provides protection against DDoS attacks for apps running on AWS
- Enables on-going threat detection and mitigation
- Has two different service levels:
    - Standard
    - Advanced

### Amazon Macie

- Utilizes machine learning to analyze data stored in Amazon S3

- Provides dashboards that show how data is being stored and accessed
- Enables alerts if it detects anything unusual about data access

### Amazon Inspector

- Enables scanning of Amazon EC2 instances for security vulnerabilities
- Charged by instance per assessment run
- Two types of rules packages:
    - Network reachability assessment
    - Host assessment

## Deploying Pre-defined Solutions

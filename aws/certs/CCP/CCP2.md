<aside>
üóìÔ∏è Wednesday 28th July 2021

</aside>

## Overview

This course includes interactive exercise files, with guided notes and study guide, and AWS Services lists.

## Methods of Interacting with AWS

There are 3 different ways to interact with AWS:

1. AWS Console - Users can leverage their browser to configure resources
2. AWS CLI - Command line access for administering AWS resources
3. AWS SDK - Programmatic access to manager AWS resources

> ***AWS Management Console** - a web and app based interface for interacting with most of the 150+ AWS services. All major browsers and mobile operating systems are supported.*
> 

> ***AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** - a tool to manage your use of AWS services from the command line on Windows, Mac and Linux. Most every task that can be done in the console can be done with the CLI.*
> 
- Example command to list users: aws iam list-users

> ***AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)*** - Programming language-specific resources that allow you to interact with AWS services via code. This approach enables you to automate many aspects of how you interact with the platform.
> 

![AWS SDK Supported Languages](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%201.png)

AWS SDK Supported Languages

### Interacting with AWS

- Console is a great method for testing out AWS services
- Repeating tasks can be automated using the CLI or SDK
- SDK enables automation of AWS tasks within custom applications
- Most all services and actions can be performed in any of the three

## Using the AWS Console

In this demo, we'll be:

- Accessing the AWS Console in the browser
- Reviewing login differences for root and IAM users
- Selecting a specific region
- Reviewing the list of services supported in the AWS Console

By modifying the dropdown for region in the console, it will change the context the console is operating in. For example, selecting a different region will change the region we launch new resources in. This affects **most** services. 

We can use the search box to search for services.

For Route 53, region is not applicable, as it is a global service - signified in the dropdown. 

## Using the AWS CLI

In this demo, we'll be:

- Accessing AWS Access keys
- Reviewing installation instructions for the CLI
- Configuring the AWS CLI for a specific user
- Interacting with AWS utilizing the CLI

FYI: DO NOT CREATE ROOT USER ACCESS KEYS, CREATE AN IAM USER INSTEAD

Username > Security Credentials

Select 'Access keys'

Create an Access Key

**CLI Install Guide**

<aside>
üóìÔ∏è Wednesday 28th July 2021  |  Thursday 29th July 2021

</aside>

## Overview

> ***Compute Services** - A service that enables you to leverage cloud-based virtual machines for workloads. This could be serving web content to visitors, running a database, or calculating statistics from a data set.*
> 

We'll be looking at :

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%202.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%202.png)

- Amazon EC2 - a core, foundational service of AWS, that lets us run virtual servers.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Paas) - a platform for scaling and deploying web apps and services
- AWS Lambda - Enables compute without managing any servers

We'll also be covering:

- Introducing Amazon EC2 capabilities
- Exploring pricing approaches for EC2 instances
- Introducing the capabilities of AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Reviewing use cases for Elastic Beanstalk
- Introducing AWS Lambda

## Amazon EC2 Overview

EC2 is one of the fundamental, core services of AWS.

> ***Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. - Amazon Web Services*
> 

### Amazon EC2 Use Cases

- Web application hosting
- Batch processing of data
- Web services endpoint
- Desktop in the cloud

### Amazon EC2 Concepts

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%203.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%203.png)

### Amazon EC2 Instance Types

- Defines the processor, memory and storage type
- Cannot be changed without downtime
- Provided in the following categories
    - General purpose
    - Compute, memory, and storage optimized
    - Accelerated computing
- Pricing is based on instance type
- Some instance types have unique capabilities

**Pricing**

*Can vary over time, and by region*

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%204.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%204.png)

### Root Device Type

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%205.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%205.png)

Most work on EC2, we'll want to use EBS, unless we have a specific reason not to. 

### Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

*Note, this can be pronounced A.M.I or AMY*

- Template for an EC2 instance including configuration, operating system, and data
- AWS provides many AMI's that can be leveraged
- AMI's can be shared across AWS accounts
- Custom AMI's can be created based on your configuration
- Commercial AMI's area available in the AWS Marketplace

## Amazon EC2 Purchase Types

![AWS EC2 Purchase Options Diagram](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%206.png)

AWS EC2 Purchase Options Diagram

### Reserved Instances

> ***Reserved instances** - Provides discounts over the on-demand model when you can commit to a specific period of time (1 or 3 years). In addition, it provides a capacity reservation for the specific instance type that you specify.*
> 

**Types of Reserved Instance**

- **Standard**: Highest discount, works for steady workloads. The instance type is locked in for the reservation period
- **Convertible**: Enables the conversion of attributes, works for steady workloads. Attributes are convertible up to the equal value of the reserved instance
- **Scheduled**: Works for a time window you reserve, good for a predictable workload

**Standard Reserved Instance Cost Models**

- **All Upfront**: Entire cost for the 1 or 3 year period is paid upfront. Highest level of savings, but the biggest upfront investment
- **Partial Upfront**: Part of the 1 or 3 year cost is paid upfront along with a reduced monthly cost
- **No Upfront**: No upfront payment is made, but there will be a reduced monthly cost

### Savings Plan

- Similar in concept to reserved instances
- Supports compute with EC2, Fargate, and Lambda
- Unlike Reserved Instances, it does not reserve capacity
- Provide savings of up to 72%
- Comes in 1 or 3 year terms

### Spot Instances

> ***Spot instances** - Enable you to leverage excess EC2 compute capacity, that might exist within an availability zone.*
> 
- Can provide up to 90% discount over on-demand pricing
- There is a market price for instance types per availability zone called the Spot price
- When you request instances, if your bid is higher than Spot price they will launch
- If the Spot price grows to exceed your bid, the instances will be terminated
- Spot instances can be notified 2 minutes prior to termination

**This can only work for workloads that can start and stop immediately, without affecting what we're trying to do**

### Dedicated Host

> ***Dedicated Host** - The dedicated host pricing model gives you a dedicated physical server. It will be the most expensive option, but it may be required for either server software licensing or do to a compliance requirement.*
> 

### Amazon EC2 Purchase Options Review

- If you have an instance that is consistent and always needed, you should purchase a Standard or Convertible Reserved Instance
- If you have batch processing where the process can start and stop without affecting the job, you should leverage Spot Instances
- If you have an inconsistent need for instances that cannot be stopped without affecting the job, leverage On-Demand Instances
- If you have specific per-server licensing or if you have a compliance requirement for a dedicated server, you should use Dedicated Host
- If you are leveraging Lambda and/or Fargate alongside EC2 and want to achieve discounts for 1 or 3 years, choose a Savings Plan
- If you have a predictable but not steady workload in EC3, you should purchase a Scheduled Reserved Instance

### Reserved Instance EC2 Pricing Example

## Launching EC2 Instances

We'll need to understand EC2 for the exam, but not necessarily have experience launching an EC2 Instance. This module gives us a practical demo of launching a new AWS EC2 Instance to help us better understand the procedure. 

This demo will cover:

- Launching a new EC2 Instance based on an AWS AMI
- Exploring the EC2 launch wizard in the AWS Console
- Configuring an EC2 Instance to be used as a web server
- Terminating an EC2 Instance

### Launch Procedure

1. To launch an EC2 Instance, we need to navigate to dashboard and search for EC2, which will take us to the launch console
2. From the launch console, we need to select '**Select Launch Instance**'
3. From this page, we can choose an AMI, we're selecting the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**, as it is free-tier eligible
4. We need to choose an instance type - we're using the **t2.micro** type, as it is free-tier eligible
5. After choosing our type, we can select '**Configure Instance Details**'.
6. In the instance details screen, we can choose how many instances we want, and if we would like it to be a spot instance:

> ***DNS** translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. - Wikipedia*
> 

In the console, Route 53 is marked as 'Global' - 'Route 53 does not require region selection.'

DNS changes take time to propagate globally. 

We can configure Route 53 to have automatic failover, pointing traffic from an unavailable region to an available one. 

## Elastic Load Balancing

> ***Elasticity** is the ability for the infrastructure supporting an application to grow and contract based on how much it is used at a point in time.*
> 

To route users to the correct infrastructure, we can use Elastic Load Balancing.

### Elastic Load Balancing

- Distributes traffic across multiple targets
- Integrates with EC2, ECS, and Lambda
- Supports one or more AZ's in a region
- Has three types of load balancers:
    - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    - Classic Load Balancer (Classic / ELB)

### Scaling on Amazon EC2

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2037.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2037.png)

Vertical Scaling is changing the instance type to a larger one. 

Horizontal Scaling is adding additional instance clones to handle the the application load. 

**Horizontal Scaling is the preferred choice, as it incurs no downtime.** 

## Amazon CloudFront and API Gateway

### Amazon CloudFront

- Content delivery network (CDN)
- Enables users to get content from server closest to them
- Supports static and dynamic content
- Utilizes AWS Edge Locations
- Includes advanced security features
    - AWS Shield for DDoS
    - AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

CloudFront leverages the AWS Edge Locations to deliver your content globally in a matter of minutes.

![AWS Edge Location Map](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2038.png)

AWS Edge Location Map

### Amazon API Gateway

- Fully managed API management service
- Directly integrates with multiple AWS services
- Provides monitoring & metrics on API calls
- Supports VPC and on-premise private applications

## AWS Global Accelerator

> *AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that sends your user's traffic through Amazon Web Service's global network infrastructure, improving your internet user performance by up to 60%. - Amazon Web Services*
> 
- Utilizes IP addresses that route to edge locations
- Once request reaches edge locations, traffic is routed through AWS network
- Can route requests to many AWS resources:
    - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    - EC2 Instances
    - Elastic IP address

### Performance Improvements

- Distance between user and initial endpoint is minimized by using edge locations
- Traffic is optimized by using AWS network instead of public Internet
- Results in improvement of first byre latency, jitter, and throughput
- Provides superior fault tolerance by not relying on DNS resolution

### AWS Global Accelerator Use Cases

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2039.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2039.png)

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

> ***S3 Transfer Acceleration** is a feature that can be enabled per bucket that allows for optimized uploading of data using the AWS Edge Locations as a part of Amazon CloudFront.*
> 

## Hosting a Website on Amazon S3

In this demo, we'll be:

- Creating a new S3 bucket
- Uploading objects to an S3 bucket
- Accessing objects from an S3 bucket using a URL
- Configuring a bucket for website hosting

### Bucket Creation Procedure

1. Launch S3 from the AWS Console
2. Select '**Create bucket**'
3. Enter a unique name and region. Bucket names must be **globally unique:**

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2042.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2042.png)

1. We're choosing to **not** set any versioning or logging options
2. By default, buckets are private, so we need to unblock public access and acknowledge the warning:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2043.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2043.png)

1. Once we review the settings, we can click '**Create bucket**', and see the bucket in the bucket dashboard:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2044.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2044.png)

### Website Creation Procedure

1. We need to enter our bucket from the dashboard, and select '**Upload**'
2. We're going to upload the demo files:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2045.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2045.png)

1. We're can change the object ACL's here (we're going to leave them as is):

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2046.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2046.png)

1. We can choose our Storage Class here too (we're going to leave it as Standard): 

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2047.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2047.png)

1. We're going to opt to use an encryption key, and let AWS manage the key for us. This ensures the data is encrypted at rest:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2048.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2048.png)

1. Now we've confirmed our settings, we can select '**Upload**'
2. We can view the files in our bucket: 

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2049.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2049.png)

1. By clicking into the file, we can see it's properties, and even open it's URL:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2050.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2050.png)

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_21.53.22.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_21.53.22.png)

We've connected our user signup process to an SNS topic. This topic integrates the user into our CRM using a Lambda function, adds the user into an SQS queue to allow our salespeople to follow up with them, and sends out an email to the regional sales director for that area. 

SNS notifications are ephemeral - if a service isn't listening for a notification, it will miss it forever.

### Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

- Fully managed message queue service
- Enables you to build decoupled and fault tolerant applications
- Supports up to 256KB data payload
- Allows messages to be stored up to 14 days
- Provides two types of queues:
    - Standard queue - no order
    - FIFO (first in, first out)

### Example SNS & SQS Architecture

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2069.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2069.png)

A user order comes into our e-commerce platform. The order notification goes into an SNS Topic, which fans out to multiple places:

1. The fulfilment SQS queue which stores our orders, and pushes them into the order fulfilment service, which fulfils the order.
2. The analytics SQS queue, which stores the information about which items users are ordering, for a BI function. To drop it into our data warehouse, we have an Analytics Ingestion Service that uses Lambda to process data ingestion. 

**SQS Fault Tolerance**

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2070.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2070.png)

We encounter an issue with our Analytics Ingestion Service, and it goes offline. Whilst this service is offline, the SQS queue is continuing to store notifications, ready for the service to come online.

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_21.56.58.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_21.56.58.png)

We encounter an issue with the server hosting our Order Fulfilment Service, and the server goes offline. Whilst the server is offline, the SQS queue is continuing to store notifications, ready for the service to come back online. 

This is what we describe as fault-tolerant infrastructure.

## AWS Step Functions

- Enables orchestration of workflows through a fully manages service
- Supports a serverless architectures
- Can support complex workflows including error handling
- Charged per state transition along with the other AWS services leveraged - if we have 4 steps in our function, we'll be charged each time we change steps. If this is running on Lambda, we'll be charged the standard Lambda rates too.
- Workflows are defined using Amazon States Language

### Example Step Function & States Language

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2071.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2071.png)

## Overview

Management & Governance Services refers to 6 different services:

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2072.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Untitled%2072.png)

In this module, we'll be:

- Reviewing the ecosystem of services that are provided for management
- Examining how to create an audit trail with AWS CloudTrail
- Exploring how you track infrastructure with CloudWatch and Config
- Introducing infrastructure automation with CloudFormation
- Looking at operational insights with Systems Manager
- Reviewing AWS Organizations leveraging Control Tower

## AWS CloudTrail

> *With **CloudTrail**, you can loc, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.* 
- Amazon Web Services
> 
- Inserts audit trial in an S3 bucker or into CloudWatch Logs
- Logs events in the regions in which they occur
- Meets many compliance requirements for infrastructure auditing
- As a best practice, it should be enabled on every AWS account
- Can be consolidated into an Organizational trail using AWS Organizations

### AWS CloudTrail Use Cases

- Compliance requirement
- Forensic analysis
- Operational analysis
- Troubleshooting

## Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Config

### Managing Infrastructure

These are the key services that we will need to know for our AWS CPP Exam:

### Amazon CloudWatch

- Monitoring and management service
- Collects logs, metrics, and events from most AWS services - most services integrate with CloudWatch by default
- Enables alarms based on metrics
- Provides visualization capabilities for metrics
- Allows for custom dashboards based on collected metrics

**Sample CloudWatch Dashboard**

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_22.00.50.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_22.00.50.png)

### AWS Config

> ***AWS Config** continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and alls you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.* 
- Amazon Web Services
> 
- Provides configuration history for infrastructure
- Works against rules that you can customize or even create custom validations
- Includes conformance packs for compliance standards including PCI-DSS
- Can work with AWS Organizations for both cross-region and cross-account setup
- Provides remediation steps for infrastructure not meeting criteria

## AWS Systems Manager

> ***AWS Systems Manager** provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS Resources.*
- Amazon Web Services
> 
- Provides multiple tools that make it easier to manage your AWS infrastructure
- Enables automation tasks for common maintenance actions
- Gives a secure way to access servers using only AWS credentials
- Stores commonly used parameters securely for operational use (e.g. instead of providing applications with a database password, they can contact systems manager for auth)

## AWS CloudFormation

- Managed service for provisioning infrastructure based on templates
- No additional charge - only pay for the resources that we launch
- Templates can be YAML or JSON
- Enables infrastructure as code
- Manages dependencies between resources
- Provides drift detection to find changes in your infrastructure

### Example Cloud Formation YAML

![Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_22.01.53.png](Understanding%20AWS%20Core%20Services%2029f55b24d27946dab38fbf3ba6199c6a/Screenshot_2021-07-31_at_22.01.53.png)

The code above, if placed in a CloudFormation template, would create a single S3 bucket.

## AWS OpsWorks

- Configuration management service
- Provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet
- Configuration is defined as code for servers
- Chef and Puppet manage the lifecycle of those configuration changes with servers
- Works in a hybrid cloud architecture for both cloud-based and on-premise servers

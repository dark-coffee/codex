AWS have created a tools management utility, **AWS.Tools.Installer**, which allows you to Install, Update, and Manage the subsets of AWS tools. Any of the tools you can install using the installer, can also be installed from the PowerShell gallery using the tool name, in the format AWS.Tools.[name].

To install the AWS PowerShell CLI Tools Installer:

```powershell
  Install-Module AWS.Tools.Installer
```

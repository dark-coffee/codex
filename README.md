# Introduction

This is `version one` of cortex, a digital garden containing the contents of my brain.  
This site is a gitbook, with all content pulled from github!

Ultimately, lots of these pages will start and end life as curated link dumps of interesting things. Some of the topics I'm really into will get fleshed out more over time.

## Digital Gardens

**Grow your own!**  There's some great resources out there for building your own digital garden, namely [/r/digitalgardens](https://reddit.com/r/digitalgardens) & [Nikita Voloboev's Wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/)!

## Platforms
